# Insecure Content Setting

For our demo website, we communicate with our API server and AI engine using the HTTP protocol. However, due to security concerns, certain browsers (e.g., Chrome) restrict HTTP communication on HTTPS pages.

To access our explorer demo site at [https://l2vista.web.app/](https://l2vista.web.app/), you may need to permit "Insecure content" in the site settings. Here's how:

1. ⚠️ Click on the "Not Secure" label in the address bar.
2. ⚙️ Navigate to "Site Settings".
3. 🔓 Set "Insecure content" to "Allow".
4. 🔄 Refresh the webpage.

> **Please note:** Allowing insecure content can pose potential security risks. Only make this change if you trust the source.
